The films industry has always seen rapid growth and some movies are making so much of buisness
whereas opposite to this some movie did not make much buisness. There are multiple factor on
which the success of movie depends. On the basis of some important features we can predict that
how much buisness movie will do.Earlier, the films industry used to utilize the knowledge of
specific industry trends, the basic rule of thumb approaches and traditional wisdom and intuition to
predict the buisness of particular films. This method was never very accurate or reliable.With the
emerging technology, Machine learning can predict movie buisness more accurately.

OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT DESIGN :-
1. Visualization of the data(null values,mean,std,etc) and relationship among different attributes of
data
2. Dealing with null values(drop rows or fill by 0) depending on relationship among attributes
3. Handling text columns(using LabelEncoder)
4. Selecting a good model from some supervised regression model (LinearRegression,
DecisionTreeRegressor, SVM XGBRegressor ),the model that will give better score from all will be
considered as final solution and further will be compared with BenchMark model.
4. Fine tune the model:- Selecting best parameters value (Cross-Validation,grid search can be used)
5. Evaluating the final score
